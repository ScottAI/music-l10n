Localization for music

Localizing music involves retrofitting existing music software (and writing new ones) with the ability to represent and process musical systems from around the world, not just Western Music (whatever that is).

The ultimate goal is to become the [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) of music.

For now, this repo will contain no code, but only localization issues to fix with other projects.
