Music localization

Localizing music involves retrofitting existing music software (and writing new ones) with the ability to represent and process musical systems from around the world, not just (standard 12-TET) Western Music.

The ultimate goal is to become the [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) of music.

For now, check out the prototype [Sheet Player](https://github.com/infojunkie/music-l10n/tree/master/experiments/sheet-player) which supports arbitrary tunings and microtonal music notation.
