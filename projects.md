# Interesting open source music projects

## music theory and musicology

- [Musimat](http://www.musimat.com/) is the music library that complements the incredible 2-volume book [Musimathics](http://www.musimathics.com/) by Gareth Loy. The library is written in outdated C++ and distributed as a Visual Studio project, so it needs serious cleanup. It does contain key music abstractions (Pitch, Rhythm, etc.) and some key algorithms, including different tuning systems.

- [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertlab/music21), a toolkit from MIT for Computational Musicology.

- [Humdrum](https://github.com/kroger/humdrum), a toolkit for music research.

- [python-mingus](https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus), an advanced, cross-platform music theory and notation package for Python with MIDI file and playback support.

- [tonal](https://github.com/danigb/tonal) - music theory in Javascript.

- [teoria](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) - music theory in Javascript.

- [music_theory](https://github.com/beneggett/music_theory) - music theory in Ruby.

- [rb-music-theory](https://github.com/chrisbratlien/rb-music-theory) - music theory in Ruby.

- [music-theory](https://github.com/go-music-theory/music-theory) - music theory in Go.

- [Varèse](https://github.com/WChargin/varese) - Varèse pitch space calculations as a web app.

- [Sator](https://github.com/calebsmith/Sator) - Atonal music analysis in Python.

## music information retrieval

- [Essentia](https://github.com/MTG/essentia) and [Gaia](https://github.com/MTG/gaia) - C++ libraries for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval.

- [Chromagram Estimation & Chord Detection](https://github.com/adamstark/Chord-Detector-and-Chromagram) - C++ code from a conference paper and PhD thesis.

## notation

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) - The LaTeX of music notation.

- [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) - Great music notation editor.

- [Vexflow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) - Javascript music engraving library - great codebase, good community, budding ecosystem.

## sheet music optical recognition

- [Audiveris](https://audiveris.kenai.com/) and [libreveris](https://github.com/jlpoolen/libreveris) - Java music scanner

## generation

- [MMA](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/) - Musical MIDI Accompaniment, the daddy of playalong generators.

- [ChordTrane](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane) - very decent playalong generator à la iReal Pro. Written in Scala, packaged as a web application, so the core logic is buried deep inside the repo: [here are the core music abstractions](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/MusicRepresentation) and [here is the generator proper](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/Playback).

- [Impro-Visor](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/), (short for “Improvisation Advisor”) is a music notation program designed to help jazz musicians compose and hear solos similar to ones that might be improvised.

- [JazzML](https://github.com/evancchow/jazzml) - Computational jazz improvisation powered by machine learning.

- [deepjazz](https://github.com/jisungk/deepjazz) - Using Keras & Theano for deep learning driven jazz generation.

## playback

- [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/) - Javascript MIDI player.

- [FluidSynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org/) - a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2 specifications.

## synthesis and composition

- [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/), a programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

- [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), a visual programming language for multimedia.

- [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/), an open source audio environment designed to explore new musical ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building, live-coding and collaborative jamming.

- [alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda), a music programming language for musicians.

- [Leipzig](https://github.com/ctford/leipzig) - A composition library for Clojure and Clojurescript.

- [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi), a live coding synth environment.
