# Interesting music projects

## theory

- [Musimat](http://www.musimat.com/) is the music library that complements the incredible 2-volume book [Musicmathics](http://www.musimathics.com/) by Gareth Loy. The librry is written in outdated C++ and distributed as a Visual Studio project, so it needs serious cleanup. It does contain key music abstractions (Pitch, Rhythm, etc.) and some key algorithms, including different tuning systems.

- [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertlab/music21), a toolkit from MIT for "Computational Musicology". 'Nuff said.

- [python-mingus](https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus), "an advanced, cross-platform music theory and notation package for Python with MIDI file and playback support".



## notation

- [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) - THE open source music notation editor.

- [Vexflow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) - Javascript music engraving library - great codebase, good community, budding ecosystem. The way to go for Web=based music sheets. 

## generation

- [alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda), "a music programming language for musicians".

- [ChordTrane](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane) - very decent playalong generator Ã  la iReal Pro. Written in Scala, packaged as a web application, so the core logic is buried deep inside the repo: [here are the core music abstractions](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/MusicRepresentation) and [here is the generator proper](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/Playback).
