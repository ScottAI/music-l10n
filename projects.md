# Interesting open source music projects

## music theory and musicology

- [Musimat](http://www.musimat.com/) is the music library that complements the incredible 2-volume book [Musimathics](http://www.musimathics.com/) by Gareth Loy. The library is written in outdated C++ and distributed as a Visual Studio project, so it needs serious cleanup. It does contain key music abstractions (Pitch, Rhythm, etc.) and some key algorithms, including different tuning systems.

- [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertlab/music21), a toolkit from MIT for Computational Musicology.

- [Humdrum](https://github.com/kroger/humdrum), a toolkit for music research.

- [Chromagram Estimation & Chord Detection](https://github.com/adamstark/Chord-Detector-and-Chromagram) - C++ code from a conference paper and PhD thesis.

## notation and engraving

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) - The LaTeX of music notation.

- [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) - Great music notation editor.

- [Belle, Bonne, Sage](https://github.com/burnson/Belle) - an experimental music engraver in C++.

- [Verovio](https://github.com/rism-ch/verovio) - a fast, portable and lightweight library for engraving [Music Encoding Initiative (MEI)](http://www.music-encoding.org/) music scores into SVG. Verovio can also render Plain and Easy (PAE) code and DARMS code and has a basic MusicXML import function. It is designed as a tool usable as a one-step conversion tool and it is written in pure standard C++ with no dependencies on third-party frameworks and libraries.

## sheet music optical recognition

- [Audiveris](https://audiveris.kenai.com/) and [libreveris](https://github.com/jlpoolen/libreveris) - Java music scanner

- [Overscore](https://github.com/acieroid/overscore) - OMR system and text-based musical notation

## generation

- [MMA](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/) - Musical MIDI Accompaniment, the daddy of playalong generators. Highly recommended.

- [ChordTrane](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane) - very decent playalong generator à la iReal Pro. Written in Scala, packaged as a web application, so the core logic is buried deep inside the repo: [here are the core music abstractions](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/MusicRepresentation) and [here is the generator proper](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/Playback).

- [Impro-Visor](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/), (short for “Improvisation Advisor”) is a music notation program designed to help jazz musicians compose and hear solos similar to ones that might be improvised.

- [JazzML](https://github.com/evancchow/jazzml) - Computational jazz improvisation powered by machine learning.

- [deepjazz](https://github.com/jisungk/deepjazz) - Using Keras & Theano for deep learning driven jazz generation.

## playback

- [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/) - Javascript MIDI player.

- [FluidSynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org/) - a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2 specifications.

## synthesis and composition

- [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/), a programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

- [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), a visual programming language for multimedia.

- [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/), an open source audio environment designed to explore new musical ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building, live-coding and collaborative jamming.

- [alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda), a music programming language for musicians.

- [Leipzig](https://github.com/ctford/leipzig), a composition library for Clojure and Clojurescript.

- [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi), a live coding synth environment.

- [Klangmeister](https://github.com/ctford/klangmeister), a musical scratchpad.

- [Extempore](http://extempore.moso.com.au/), a programming language and runtime environment designed to support 'cyberphysical programming'.

## cultural preservation

- [Mutopia](https://github.com/MutopiaProject/MutopiaProject) - free sheet music repository

- [Open Goldberg Variations](http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/) - The Open Goldberg Variations (Johann Sebastian Bach, BWV 988), played by Kimiko Ishizaka on a Bösendorfer 290 Imperial piano, are free to download and share. They are governed by the Creative Commons Zero license, which means that they are a part of the public domain, and every use of them is allowed.

- [Lost Voices](http://digitalduchemin.org/) - focusing on a neglected but important repertory of polyphonic songs from mid-sixteenth-century France, this unique project puts old books before a diverse audience of modern scholars and musicians in ways that will prompt renewed understanding of these cultural artifacts and their meanings. It is dedicated to sixteen sets of books expertly crafted by the Parisian printer Nicolas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568.
