# Interesting music projects

## theory

- [Musimat](http://www.musimat.com/) is the music library that complements the incredible 2-volume book [Musicmathics](http://www.musimathics.com/) by Gareth Loy. The library is written in outdated C++ and distributed as a Visual Studio project, so it needs serious cleanup. It does contain key music abstractions (Pitch, Rhythm, etc.) and some key algorithms, including different tuning systems.

- [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertlab/music21), a toolkit from MIT for "Computational Musicology". 'Nuff said.

- [python-mingus](https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus), "an advanced, cross-platform music theory and notation package for Python with MIDI file and playback support".

- [tonal](https://github.com/danigb/tonal) - music theory in Javascript.

- [teoria](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) - music theory in Javascript.

- [music_theory](https://github.com/beneggett/music_theory) - music theory in Ruby.

- [rb-music-theory](https://github.com/chrisbratlien/rb-music-theory) - music theory in Ruby.

- [music-theory](https://github.com/go-music-theory/music-theory) - music theory in Go.

- [Varèse](https://github.com/WChargin/varese) - Varèse pitch space calculations as a web app.

- [Sator](https://github.com/calebsmith/Sator) - Atonal music analysis in Python.

## audio analysis

- [Essentia](https://github.com/MTG/essentia) and [Gaia](https://github.com/MTG/gaia) - C++ libraries for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval.

## notation

- [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) - THE open source music notation editor.

- [Vexflow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) - Javascript music engraving library - great codebase, good community, budding ecosystem. The way to go for Web=based music sheets. 

## generation

- [alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda), "a music programming language for musicians".

- [ChordTrane](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane) - very decent playalong generator à la iReal Pro. Written in Scala, packaged as a web application, so the core logic is buried deep inside the repo: [here are the core music abstractions](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/MusicRepresentation) and [here is the generator proper](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/Playback).

## playback

- [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/) - Javascript MIDI player
