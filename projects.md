# Interesting open source music projects

## music theory and musicology

- [Musimat](http://www.musimat.com/) is the music library that complements the incredible 2-volume book [Musimathics](http://www.musimathics.com/) by Gareth Loy. The library is written in outdated C++ and distributed as a Visual Studio project, so it needs serious cleanup. It does contain key music abstractions (Pitch, Rhythm, etc.) and some key algorithms, including different tuning systems.

- [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertlab/music21), a toolkit from MIT for Computational Musicology.

- [Humdrum](https://github.com/kroger/humdrum), a toolkit for music research.

- [python-mingus](https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus), an advanced, cross-platform music theory and notation package for Python with MIDI file and playback support.

- [tonal](https://github.com/danigb/tonal) - music theory in Javascript.

- [teoria](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) - music theory in Javascript.

- [music_theory](https://github.com/beneggett/music_theory) - music theory in Ruby.

- [music-theory](https://github.com/go-music-theory/music-theory) - music theory in Go.

- [music-theory](https://github.com/daveyarwood/music-theory) - music theory in Clojure.

- [Varèse](https://github.com/WChargin/varese) - Varèse pitch space calculations as a web app.

## music information retrieval

- [Essentia](https://github.com/MTG/essentia) and [Gaia](https://github.com/MTG/gaia) - C++ libraries for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval.

- [Chromagram Estimation & Chord Detection](https://github.com/adamstark/Chord-Detector-and-Chromagram) - C++ code from a conference paper and PhD thesis.

## notation and engraving

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) - The LaTeX of music notation.

- [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) - Great music notation editor.

- [Vexflow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) - Javascript music engraving library - great codebase, good community, budding ecosystem.

- [Belle, Bonne, Sage](https://github.com/burnson/Belle) - an experimental music engraver in C++.

## sheet music optical recognition

- [Audiveris](https://audiveris.kenai.com/) and [libreveris](https://github.com/jlpoolen/libreveris) - Java music scanner

- [Overscore](https://github.com/acieroid/overscore) - OMR system and text-based musical notation

## generation

- [MMA](http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/) - Musical MIDI Accompaniment, the daddy of playalong generators. Highly recommended.

- [ChordTrane](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane) - very decent playalong generator à la iReal Pro. Written in Scala, packaged as a web application, so the core logic is buried deep inside the repo: [here are the core music abstractions](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/MusicRepresentation) and [here is the generator proper](https://github.com/larryoatmeal/ChordTrane/tree/master/app/models/Playback).

- [Impro-Visor](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/), (short for “Improvisation Advisor”) is a music notation program designed to help jazz musicians compose and hear solos similar to ones that might be improvised.

- [JazzML](https://github.com/evancchow/jazzml) - Computational jazz improvisation powered by machine learning.

- [deepjazz](https://github.com/jisungk/deepjazz) - Using Keras & Theano for deep learning driven jazz generation.

## playback

- [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/) - Javascript MIDI player.

- [FluidSynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org/) - a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2 specifications.

## synthesis and composition

- [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/), a programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

- [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), a visual programming language for multimedia.

- [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/), an open source audio environment designed to explore new musical ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building, live-coding and collaborative jamming.

- [alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda), a music programming language for musicians.

- [Leipzig](https://github.com/ctford/leipzig), a composition library for Clojure and Clojurescript.

- [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi), a live coding synth environment.

## cultural preservation

- [Lost Voices](http://digitalduchemin.org/) - focusing on a neglected but important repertory of polyphonic songs from mid-sixteenth-century France, this unique project puts old books before a diverse audience of modern scholars and musicians in ways that will prompt renewed understanding of these cultural artifacts and their meanings. It is dedicated to sixteen sets of books expertly crafted by the Parisian printer Nicolas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568.
